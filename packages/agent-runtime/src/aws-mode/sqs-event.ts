 * Per-record outcome from the SQS Lambda entry shim. The status enum is

 *   - `handled-stale-complete` — handler succeeded but another worker had
 *                              already reclaimed the row by the time
 *                              `complete()` ran (ADR-0006 watchdog race);
 *                              the work itself completed, so SQS ACKs.
 *   - `handled-complete-write-failed` — handler succeeded (for ATC the terminal
 *                              reply was already delivered) but the `complete()`
 *                              marker write THREW after SDK retries. Re-running
 *                              would duplicate side effects, so SQS ACKs and the
 *                              in-flight row lingers to its `claimUntil` bound
 *                              (ADR-0006 § complete() write-failure).
 *   - `duplicate-completed`  — idempotency hit, prior completion; SQS ACKs.
 *   - `duplicate-in-flight`  — idempotency hit, prior still in-flight; SQS keeps the message.
 *   - `envelope-parse-failed`— body wasn't JSON; treated as malformed, kept for DLQ via max-receive.
 *   - `envelope-rejected`    — HMAC / clock-skew / unknown consumer / allowedKinds.
 *   - `handler-failed`       — dispatch threw; claim moved to immediately-expired so the next
 *                              redelivery reclaims on the first try.
